                  The idea for our web application, called TheRedditing, revolves around users being
                  able to view and analyze data that is retrieved from reddit, which is a website
                  that can be viewed at www.reddit.com. Reddit is basically a bulletin board for
                  news and information. The content that is posted to the site is categorized into
                  what are called subreddits. Each subreddit is dedicated to a specific topic, such
                  as sports, or movies, and all posts to the subreddit must be connected to this
                  topic. Users of reddit can subscribe to those subreddits that interest them as well
                   as comment, and vote on any posts that are made making it so that the most popular
                    posts will have thousands of comments and votes associated with them.

                  <h2 class="title">Features</h2>
					<p class="text">
            For our web application users will be required to signup/login and will be met initially
             with a list of popular topics to choose from. After choosing some number of these topics
              the user will be presented with links and information for subreddits that closely match
               their interests. At this point the user will be able to decide whether or not they
               would like to see information related to these subreddits. For each subreddit that
               they select they will be able to see the associated top posts, top comments, most
               downvoted comments, and most controversial comments on their home page in our
               application. As well, many reddit posts involve news stories and often include the
               link to the original source. We would like to provide the user of our application the
                option of going to the subreddit or just clicking on the link and being taken
                directly to the original source. A typical use case of our web application would be
                that a user is interested in a topic such as “sports”, and sets a preference for the
                 sports category. The user is then able to interact with the subreddits associated
                 with sports and analyze the information gathered by our web application. All of this
                  should be achievable through the integration of the reddit API with our application
                   as the API gives access to numerous different data fields associated with users
                   and posts.

          <h2 class="title">Goals</h2>
					<p class="text">
            The main goal of our application is to provide a convenient place for a
            user to see reddit content that is related to their interests. As well, it can be used
             as a tool that allows users to gain additional insight into the subreddits that they
             have chosen to view as we will attempt to provide the user with statistics, related to
              posts and comments, that cannot be found anywhere else. The target audience for our
              application will be individuals that already have an existing reddit account. For the
              web application we will need to create a frontend that the user interacts with that is
               customized to show only their selections. We will need to use a database to store data
                related to login information, as well as the information related to the subreddits
                that the user has decided to view. There must also be a way to pull information from
                 the database and pass it to the frontend application so that it can be formatted
                 and presented to the user. Something that we want to do, but which may not be
                 possible, is to show users popular subreddits based on their geographical location
                 which would mean also utilizing the Google maps API.
